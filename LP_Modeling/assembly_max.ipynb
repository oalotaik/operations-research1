    "A company manufactures an assembly consisting of a frame, a shaft, and a ball bearing. The company manufactures the shafts and frames but purchases the ball bearings from a ball bearing manufacturer. Each shaft must be processed on a forging machine, a lathe, and grinder. These operations require 0.5 hours, 0.2 hours, and 0.3 hours per shaft, respectively. Each frame requires 0.8 hours on a forging machine, 0.1 hours on a drilling machine, 0.3 hours on a milling machine, and 0.5 hours on a grinder. The company has 5 lathes, 10 grinders, 20 forging machines, 3 drillers, and 6 millers. Assume that each machine operates a maximum of 2400 hours per year. Formulate the problem of finding the maximum number of assembled components that can be produced as a linear program."
